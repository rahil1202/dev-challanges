Welcome to "My Team Page"! This project is a responsive web page showcasing the talented members of our team. It is designed to highlight the unique skills and contributions of each team member, created as a part of the DevChallenges' "Responsive Web Design" challenge, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The team page features a modern and professional design, with individual sections for each team member. It includes photos, bios, and links to connect with them on social media or professional platforms.
